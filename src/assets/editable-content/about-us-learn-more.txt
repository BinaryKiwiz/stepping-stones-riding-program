Stepping Stones was founded as a nonprofit in 2012 by three friends, Kylie Joseph, Nancy McChesney, and Meaghan Shaffer to connect horses and people regardless of circumstance and wealth. Fate led us to the Conejo Valley YMCA, where we put hundreds of campers on horses each summer. When the YMCA closed permanently due to COVID-19, we relocated temporarily, and finally settled in Santa Rosa Valley.
