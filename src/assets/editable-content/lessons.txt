We offer lessons in Western saddles, English saddles, and bareback pads to those 6 years old and up. They generally run an hour and a half long.

Riders are taught to catch, halter, lead, groom, clean, pick hooves, and tack their mounts before riding. After riding, riders are responsible for untacking and neatly stowing away the equipment, grooming the horse, safely putting the horse away, and sweeping.

We currently offer lessons six days a week and will offer camps during the summer. We are also vendors for several charter schools for home-schooled children. We have a limited number of riders and are often at capacity. Check in with us periodically and weâ€™ll get you in when possible!
