Our riders have many experiences besides lessons in the arena. We trail ride, attend clinics, tour vet clinics, go to horse shows, compete in regional and national horse judging and hippology contests, volunteer at horse events across the state, participate in parades and exhibitions, go camping with the horses, and more!
