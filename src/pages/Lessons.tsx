              We offer lessons in Western saddles, English saddles, and bareback
              pads to those 6 years old and up. They generally run an hour and a
              half long.

              Riders are taught to catch, halter, lead, groom, clean, pick
              hooves, and tack their mounts before riding. After riding, riders
              are responsible for untacking and neatly stowing away the
              equipment, grooming the horse, safely putting the horse away, and
              sweeping.

              We currently offer lessons six days a week and will offer camps
              during the summer. We are also vendors for several charter schools
              for home-schooled children. We have a limited number of riders and
              are often at capacity. Check in with us periodically and we’ll get
              you in when possible!
