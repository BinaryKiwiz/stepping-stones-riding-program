# EDITING THE WEBSITE

To edit website content, navigate to the following file directory:

```

Here, you can change the contents of the files to change what will render on the website. Take note that line breaks in the text files will be reflected on the website.

## **WARNING:** Make sure not to change file names

If changing an image, upload a new image with the same file name as the old image and delete (or rename) the old image.
